Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` file for your **Bike Store API** project:

# Bike Store API

This is an API for managing a Bike Store, built with **Express**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB** using **Mongoose**. The API allows you to manage products (bikes) and orders, providing basic CRUD operations with data validation and error handling.

## Features

- **Product Management (CRUD)**:
  - Add new bikes to the store.
  - Get a list of all bikes or search by category.
  - Get details of a specific bike.
  - Update bike details.
  - Delete bikes.

- **Order Management**:
  - Place an order for a bike.
  - Automatically update inventory upon order creation.
  - Handle out-of-stock situations.

- **Revenue Calculation**:
  - Calculate the total revenue generated from all orders.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB (or a MongoDB cloud service like Atlas)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bike-store-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd bike-store-api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your **MongoDB** connection in the `app.ts` file (or use a service like MongoDB Atlas):
   ```typescript
   mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/bike-store')
     .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB'))
     .catch(err => console.log('Failed to connect to MongoDB', err));
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will start on **http://localhost:3000**.

## Error Handling

The API uses proper error handling for various scenarios, including:

- **Validation errors** (e.g., invalid email, missing required fields)
- **Not Found** errors (e.g., when trying to retrieve a non-existing bike or order)
- **Server errors** (e.g., database connection issues)

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "name": "ValidationError",
    "errors": {
